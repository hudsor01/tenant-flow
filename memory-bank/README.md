# TenantFlow Memory Bank

This Memory Bank system transforms Cline from a stateless assistant into a persistent development partner that maintains comprehensive project context across all sessions.

## üìö Memory Bank Files

### Core Project Context
1. **`projectbrief.md`** - Project foundation, mission, and core requirements
2. **`productContext.md`** - Product vision, user journeys, and business context
3. **`activeContext.md`** - Current priorities, recent changes, and immediate focus
4. **`systemPatterns.md`** - Architecture decisions, code patterns, and technical standards
5. **`techContext.md`** - Technology stack, configurations, and development setup
6. **`progress.md`** - Project status, completed milestones, and known issues

## üöÄ How to Use the Memory Bank

### Starting a New Session
Simply say in chat:
```
follow your custom instructions
```
This triggers Cline to read all memory bank files and establish full project context.

### For Specific Context
Reference specific areas:
```
review the current priorities from activeContext
check systemPatterns for architecture decisions
update progress with recent milestone completion
```

### Updating the Memory Bank
After significant changes:
```
update memory bank with [specific changes/milestones]
```
