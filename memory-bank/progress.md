## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### High Priority Issues
1. **Test Infrastructure** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - 10 failing frontend test suites due to React 19 patterns
   - Backend test coverage below 80% target
   - E2E test suite needs maintenance and expansion
   - Performance: Test execution time needs optimization

2. **Code Quality Debt** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Some legacy code still uses `any` TypeScript types
   - Inconsistent import patterns (relative vs shared packages)
   - Error handling patterns vary across services
   - API documentation outdated post-Supabase migration

3. **Performance Considerations** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Large dataset queries need optimization
   - Bundle size analysis needed for client components
   - Database query performance monitoring required
   - Memory usage optimization for long-running processes

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **Documentation Gaps**
   - API documentation needs post-migration updates
   - Component Storybook stories need React 19 updates
   - Deployment procedures need documentation refresh
   - Team onboarding guide needs technical updates

2. **Development Experience**
   - Hot reload occasionally fails in development
   - Type generation process could be more automated
   - Test debugging could be more developer-friendly
   - Error messages could be more actionable
