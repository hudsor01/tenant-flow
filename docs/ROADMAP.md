1. Week 1: Device fingerprinting and tracking
2. Week 2: Concurrent session limits
3. Week 3-4: UI for device management and testing

#### Phase 3: Modern Standards (4-5 weeks)

### Technical Considerations

#### Database Schema Updates

```sql
-- MFA tables
CREATE TABLE user_mfa_settings (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  mfa_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  totp_secret TEXT,
  backup_codes TEXT[],
  phone_number TEXT,
  phone_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);

-- Device tracking
CREATE TABLE user_devices (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  device_fingerprint TEXT NOT NULL,
  device_name TEXT,
  last_active TIMESTAMP,
  trusted BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  location JSONB
);

-- Audit logs
CREATE TABLE auth_audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  event_data JSONB,
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### API Endpoints Required

- `POST /api/auth/mfa/setup` - Initialize MFA setup
- `POST /api/auth/mfa/verify` - Verify MFA code
- `GET /api/auth/devices` - List user devices
- `DELETE /api/auth/devices/:id` - Remove device
- `POST /api/auth/passkey/register` - Register passkey
- `POST /api/auth/passkey/authenticate` - Authenticate with passkey

#### Security Considerations

- Encrypt all sensitive data (TOTP secrets, backup codes)
- Rate limit all MFA endpoints aggressively
- Implement secure random generation for codes
- Use constant-time comparison for code verification
- Audit all authentication events
- Implement gradual rollout for new features

#### Performance Impact

- Additional database queries for device checking
- Redis caching for session data
- Background jobs for audit log processing
- CDN for MFA QR code generation
- Lazy loading of device management UI

### Success Metrics

    - Reduced account takeover incidents by 80%
    - Average time to detect suspicious activity: <5 minutes
- **User Experience Metrics**
    - MFA setup completion rate: >90%
    - Average MFA verification time: <3 seconds
    - Device management UI satisfaction: >4.5/5
- **Business Metrics**
    - Enterprise plan adoption increase: 25%
    - Reduced support tickets for account recovery: 40%
    - Compliance certification achievements

### Dependencies

- Supabase MFA API availability
- SMS provider integration (Twilio/SendGrid)
- WebAuthn browser support metrics
- SAML identity provider partnerships
- Security audit completion

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Low MFA adoption
    - **Mitigation**: Incentivize with security badges, gradual enforcement
- **Risk**: SMS delivery failures
    - **Mitigation**: Multiple SMS providers, TOTP fallback
- **Risk**: WebAuthn compatibility
    - **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement, fallback options
- **Risk**: Complexity overwhelming users
    - **Mitigation**: Phased rollout, extensive user education

## üìä Beyond Option C

### Future Considerations (2026+)

- Behavioral biometrics
- Zero-trust architecture
- Decentralized identity (DID)
- Quantum-resistant cryptography
- AI-powered threat detection
- Adaptive authentication based on risk scoring

## üìù Notes

- All timelines are estimates and subject to change based on priorities
- Security features will undergo external audit before release
- User feedback will drive feature prioritization
- Enterprise features may be moved up based on customer demand
