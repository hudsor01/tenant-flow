## Service Migration Sequence

### Phase 1: Properties Service (Simplest)
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours

  - [ ] `validateUpdate(data: UpdatePropertyDto)`
  - [ ] `verifyOwnership(id: string, ownerId: string)`
  - [ ] `buildStatsQuery(ownerId: string)`
- [ ] Preserve service-specific methods:
  - [ ] `getPropertiesWithStats(ownerId: string)`
  - [ ] `createPropertyWithUnits(...)`
- [ ] Add lifecycle hooks if needed:
  - [ ] `beforeCreate` for unit creation logic
  - [ ] `afterCreate` for statistics updates

#### ✅ Testing
- [ ] Run existing unit tests
- [ ] Add tests for new abstract method implementations
- [ ] Integration tests pass

### Phase 2: Leases Service (Date Validation)
**Estimated Time**: 5 hours  
**Complexity**: Medium (date validation + conflict checking)

#### ✅ Analysis
- [ ] Review current LeasesService implementation (205 lines)
- [ ] Identify date validation patterns
- [ ] Document lease conflict checking logic
- [ ] Plan integration of validation methods

#### ✅ Implementation
- [ ] Create new LeasesService extending BaseCrudService

  - [ ] `validateCreate` with date and conflict validation
  - [ ] `validateUpdate` with existing lease consideration
  - [ ] `verifyOwnership` through Unit → Property relationship
  - [ ] `buildStatsQuery` for lease statistics
- [ ] Add lifecycle hooks:
  - [ ] `beforeCreate` for date transformation
  - [ ] `beforeUpdate` for conflict checking
- [ ] Preserve service-specific methods:
  - [ ] `getByUnit(unitId, ownerId, query)`
  - [ ] `getByTenant(tenantId, ownerId, query)`

#### ✅ Testing
- [ ] Date validation tests pass
- [ ] Lease conflict detection works
- [ ] Unit relationship verification secure
- [ ] Tenant relationship queries functional
- [ ] Performance within acceptable range

#### ✅ Validation
- [ ] Lease creation prevents conflicts
- [ ] Date validation errors clear and helpful
- [ ] Update operations maintain data integrity
- [ ] Statistics aggregation accurate

### Phase 3: Documents Service (File Validation)
**Estimated Time**: 6 hours  
**Complexity**: Medium-High (file validation + multi-entity relationships)

#### ✅ Analysis
- [ ] Review current DocumentsService implementation (289 lines)
- [ ] Identify file validation constraints
- [ ] Document property/lease relationship verification
- [ ] Plan MIME type and size validation integration

#### ✅ Implementation
- [ ] Create new DocumentsService extending BaseCrudService
- [ ] Implement abstract methods:
  - [ ] `validateCreate` with file constraints validation
  - [ ] `validateUpdate` with file type checking
  - [ ] `verifyOwnership` through document relationships
  - [ ] `buildStatsQuery` for document statistics
- [ ] Add lifecycle hooks:
  - [ ] `beforeCreate` for file size transformation
  - [ ] Validation for related entity ownership
- [ ] Preserve service-specific methods:
  - [ ] `getByProperty(propertyId, ownerId, query)`
  - [ ] `getByLease(leaseId, ownerId, query)`
  - [ ] `getByType(type, ownerId, query)`

#### ✅ Testing
- [ ] File size validation enforced
- [ ] MIME type restrictions work
- [ ] URL validation functional
- [ ] Property/lease ownership verification secure
- [ ] Document type filtering accurate

#### ✅ Validation
- [ ] File upload constraints enforced
- [ ] Related entity verification prevents unauthorized access
- [ ] Document categorization works correctly
- [ ] Statistics include all document types

### Phase 4: Maintenance Service (Complex Business Logic)
**Estimated Time**: 7 hours  
**Complexity**: High (notifications + status management + email integration)

#### ✅ Analysis
- [ ] Review current MaintenanceService implementation (402 lines)
- [ ] Identify notification trigger points
- [ ] Document status transition logic
- [ ] Plan integration with email/notification services

#### ✅ Implementation
- [ ] Create new MaintenanceService extending BaseCrudService
- [ ] Implement abstract methods:
  - [ ] `validateCreate` with priority and unit validation
  - [ ] `validateUpdate` with status transition rules
  - [ ] `verifyOwnership` through Unit → Property relationship
  - [ ] `buildStatsQuery` for maintenance statistics
- [ ] Override core methods for custom logic:
  - [ ] `update` method for status transition handling
  - [ ] Custom notification triggering
- [ ] Add lifecycle hooks:
  - [ ] `afterCreate` for new request notifications
  - [ ] `afterUpdate` for status change notifications
- [ ] Preserve service-specific methods:
  - [ ] `sendNotification(notificationData, userId)`
  - [ ] `logNotification(logData, userId)`
  - [ ] `getByUnit(unitId, ownerId, query)`

#### ✅ Testing
- [ ] Priority validation enforced
- [ ] Status transitions trigger notifications
