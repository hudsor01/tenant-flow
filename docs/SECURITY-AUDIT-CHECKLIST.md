### üöÄ Deployment Checklist

#### Before Deployment

1. [ ] Run `npm audit fix` to patch known vulnerabilities
2. [ ] Run `npm run build` successfully with no errors
3. [ ] Run `npm run test` with all tests passing
4. [ ] Review all TODO comments in code
5. [ ] Verify no hardcoded secrets or API keys
6. [ ] Check bundle size is acceptable (<500KB initial)
7. [ ] Test auth flows in staging environment
8. [ ] Verify rate limiting works as expected
9. [ ] Test error scenarios and fallbacks
10. [ ] Review and update documentation

#### During Deployment

1. [ ] Enable maintenance mode if needed
2. [ ] Run database migrations
3. [ ] Clear CDN cache after deployment
4. [ ] Verify security headers are applied
5. [ ] Test critical user journeys
6. [ ] Monitor error rates
7. [ ] Check performance metrics

#### After Deployment

1. [ ] Verify all auth flows working
2. [ ] Check monitoring dashboards
3. [ ] Review security event logs
4. [ ] Test rate limiting in production
5. [ ] Verify OAuth providers working
6. [ ] Check email delivery
7. [ ] Monitor for anomalies (24 hours)
8. [ ] Document any issues found
9. [ ] Schedule security review (monthly)

### üìä Security Metrics to Track

#### Authentication Metrics

- Failed login attempts per hour
- Account lockouts per day
- Password reset requests per day
- OAuth vs email login ratio
- Session duration average
- Concurrent sessions per user

#### Security Events

- Rate limit triggers
- CSRF validation failures
- Suspicious IP activity
- Distributed attack attempts
- Account takeover attempts

#### Performance Impact

- Auth check latency (target: <100ms)
- Token refresh success rate (target: >99%)
- Cache hit rate (target: >80%)
- API response time (target: <200ms p95)

### üîê Security Contacts

- **Security Team Lead**: [Add contact]
- **DevOps On-Call**: [Add contact]
- **External Security Audit**: [Add vendor]
- **Incident Response**: [Add process]

### üìù Notes

- This checklist should be reviewed and updated quarterly
- All HIGH priority items are blocking for production deployment
- Security audit should be performed by external party annually
- Keep this document updated as new security measures are implemented
