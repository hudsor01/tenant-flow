# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of Redis Pub/Sub service integration for real-time notifications between services in the TenantFlow application. The goal is to enable efficient, scalable communication between different parts of the system using Redis as the message broker, replacing the current in-memory EventEmitter approach where appropriate.

The implementation will enhance the existing RedisPubSubService to support cross-service communication, integrate with the WebSocket system for real-time client notifications, and provide a robust foundation for future microservices architecture.

## Types

The implementation will introduce and enhance several type definitions for Redis Pub/Sub messaging:

- **PubSubMessage**: Base interface for all pub/sub messages with common fields
- **NotificationMessage**: Extended interface for user notifications with recipient and priority information
- **SystemEventMessage**: Interface for system-level events and metrics
- **ChannelPatterns**: Enum for standardized channel naming conventions
- **MessagePriority**: Enum for message priority levels (HIGH, NORMAL, LOW)

Enhanced type safety with Zod validation schemas for message payloads and improved error handling types.

## Files

The implementation will modify and create the following files:

### Modified Files:

- `apps/backend/src/redis/redis-pubsub.service.ts` - Enhanced service with better error handling, connection management, and new features
- `apps/backend/src/redis/redis.module.ts` - Updated module configuration with enhanced Redis client options
- `apps/backend/src/common/plugins/fastify-websocket-enhanced.plugin.ts` - Integration with Redis Pub/Sub for real-time notifications

### New Files:

- `apps/backend/src/redis/interfaces/pubsub.interface.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `apps/backend/src/redis/constants/channels.ts` - Standardized channel names and patterns
- `apps/backend/src/redis/utils/message-validator.ts` - Message validation and serialization utilities
- `apps/backend/src/notifications/notification-pubsub.service.ts` - Service for handling notification-specific pub/sub logic

## Functions

### Enhanced RedisPubSubService Functions:

- `publishWithRetry(channel: string, message: string | object, retries?: number)` - Enhanced publish with retry logic
- `subscribeWithPattern(pattern: string, callback: Function)` - Improved pattern subscription
- `getChannelStats(channel: string)` - New function to get channel statistics
- `batchPublish(channels: string[], message: object)` - New batch publishing capability
- `healthCheck(): Promise<boolean>` - New health check functionality

### New Notification Functions:

- `sendUserNotification(userId: string, notification: NotificationMessage)` - Send notification to specific user
- `broadcastToOrganization(orgId: string, notification: NotificationMessage)` - Broadcast to organization members
- `sendSystemEvent(event: SystemEventMessage)` - Send system-level events

## Classes

### Enhanced Classes:

- **RedisPubSubService**: Enhanced with connection pooling, better error handling, and monitoring
- **FastifyWebSocketEnhancedPlugin**: Integrated with Redis Pub/Sub for scalable real-time notifications

### New Classes:

- **NotificationPubSubService**: Dedicated service for notification handling via Redis Pub/Sub
- **PubSubMessageValidator**: Utility class for message validation and sanitization

## Dependencies

The implementation will leverage existing dependencies:

- `ioredis` (already installed) - Enhanced with connection pooling and retry strategies
- `@nestjs/event-emitter` - For local event handling alongside Redis Pub/Sub
- `zod` - For message validation (already installed)

No new dependencies required, but will enhance usage of existing Redis configuration.

## Testing

### Test Files:

- `apps/backend/src/redis/__tests__/redis-pubsub.service.spec.ts` - Unit tests for enhanced service
- `apps/backend/src/redis/__tests__/integration/pubsub.integration.spec.ts` - Integration tests
- `apps/backend/src/notifications/__tests__/notification-pubsub.service.spec.ts` - Notification-specific tests

### Testing Strategy:

- Unit tests for all new functions and enhanced features
- Integration tests for Redis connectivity and message flow
- Performance tests for high-volume scenarios
- Mock Redis for unit tests, real Redis for integration tests

## Implementation Order

1. Enhance RedisPubSubService with new features and better error handling
2. Create interfaces, constants, and utility files
3. Implement NotificationPubSubService for notification handling
4. Integrate with WebSocket system for real-time client notifications
5. Add comprehensive test coverage
6. Update documentation and usage examples
7. Performance testing and optimization
8. Final integration testing
