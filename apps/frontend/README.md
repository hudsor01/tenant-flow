This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: React 19 + Next.js 15 Compatibility

**MUST USE TURBOPACK**: This application uses React 19 with Next.js 15, which REQUIRES Turbopack bundler to avoid webpack compatibility issues. The development server is already configured to use Turbopack automatically via the `--turbo` flag.

### Known Issue Resolved

The webpack bundler has a critical incompatibility with React 19's module system that causes runtime errors:

- Error: "undefined is not an object (evaluating 'originalFactory.call')"
- Solution: Use Turbopack instead of webpack (already configured)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev  # Automatically uses Turbopack (--turbo flag)
# The above command runs: next dev --turbo
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
