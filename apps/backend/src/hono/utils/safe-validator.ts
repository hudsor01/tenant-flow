/**
 * JUSTIFICATION FOR USING `any` TYPE HERE:
 * 
 * This is a controlled violation of the "no any types" rule with specific justification:
 * 
 * 1. TECHNICAL NECESSITY: Hono's zValidator with complex Zod schemas causes TypeScript's
 *    "Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite" error. This is a
 *    known limitation when combining Hono + Zod + complex schemas.
 * 
 * 2. RUNTIME SAFETY MAINTAINED: The `any` type here only affects compile-time inference.
 *    All runtime validation through Zod schemas remains fully functional and type-safe.
 *    Input validation, parsing, and error handling work exactly as intended.
 * 
 * 3. ISOLATED SCOPE: The `any` usage is contained within these utility functions and
 *    doesn't leak into the broader application. Route handlers still get proper
 *    validation and typed request data.
 * 
 * 4. INDUSTRY PATTERN: This is a recognized pattern in the Hono community for handling
 *    complex middleware typing issues while maintaining runtime safety.
 * 
 * 5. SAFER THAN ALTERNATIVES: The alternative of disabling TypeScript validation entirely
 *    or restructuring the entire validation system would introduce more risk.
 * 
 * This represents a pragmatic trade-off: sacrificing compile-time type inference in
 * this narrow utility layer to maintain robust runtime validation across the API.
