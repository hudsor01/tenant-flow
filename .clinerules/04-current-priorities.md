# TenantFlow Current Development Priorities

## ðŸ”¥ Critical Issues (Fix First)
1. **10 Failing Frontend Tests** - Blocking development pipeline
   - React 19 compatibility issues
   - Import path updates needed
   - Mock data structure mismatches
   - Priority: Immediate fix required

2. **Supabase Migration Completion** - Remove Prisma dependencies
   - Migrate remaining services to BaseCrudService
   - Implement comprehensive RLS policies
   - Remove @prisma/client completely
   - Priority: High - affects architecture consistency

## ðŸš€ Active Feature Development
1. **Tenant Payment Flow** (#90)
   - Stripe subscription integration
   - Multi-tenant billing isolation
   - Payment failure recovery
   - Priority: High - revenue critical

2. **Notification Automation** (#92)
   - Email notification system
   - Real-time notifications via Supabase
   - Notification preferences
   - Priority: Medium - user experience

## ðŸ“Š Technical Debt
- **Backend Test Coverage**: Need 80%+ coverage across all services
- **Performance Optimization**: Large dataset handling improvements
- **Documentation**: API documentation updates post-Supabase migration

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics
- All tests passing (frontend and backend)
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- `npm run claude:check` passes consistently
- Production deployments succeed without rollbacks

## Branch Strategy
- **Main Branch**: `main` - production ready code
- **Current Feature Branch**: `feature/request-utils-composition-and-hardening`
- **Hotfix Protocol**: Direct to main for critical security issues

## When Working on These Priorities
- Focus on one critical issue at a time
- Run `npm run claude:check` after each significant change
- Test changes both locally and in staging environment
- Maintain backward compatibility during migrations
