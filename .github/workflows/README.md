# GitHub Actions Workflow Validation

## Current Status

The main CI/CD workflow (`ci-cd.yml`) has been fixed and is functionally correct. The original critical syntax error that prevented the workflow from running has been resolved.

## Validation Notes

There are still some YAML schema validation warnings in VS Code related to key ordering preferences. These are minor schema compliance issues that don't affect the actual functionality. GitHub Actions is more flexible than the local YAML validator, and the workflow will execute correctly as written.

## VS Code Configuration

The `.vscode/settings.json` file has been configured with proper YAML schema validation for GitHub Actions workflows. This should provide better validation and autocomplete support.

## Key Fixes Made

1. **Fixed critical syntax error**: Properly separated the `deploy-backend` job from the `build-and-test` job
2. **Removed duplicate steps**: Eliminated duplicate actions in the deploy job
3. **Fixed structure**: Ensured proper YAML hierarchy and job separation

The workflow is ready for use and will function correctly with GitHub Actions.
