If you're spending more than 20 hours a week on property management tasks, you're doing too much manual work. I've seen property managers cut their weekly workload from 40 hours to just 15 hours using the right tools. Here's exactly how TenantFlow makes that possible.

## The Time-Wasting Tasks Killing Your Productivity

Most property managers waste time on the same repetitive tasks every week:

**Rent Collection and Follow-ups**: 8-12 hours per week
- Tracking who has and hasn't paid
- Sending payment reminders
- Processing payments manually
- Following up on late payments
- Calculating and applying late fees

**Tenant Communications**: 6-10 hours per week
- Answering the same questions repeatedly
- Scheduling property viewings
- Responding to maintenance requests
- Following up on lease renewals

**Paperwork and Documentation**: 5-8 hours per week
- Creating lease agreements
- Managing application paperwork
- Filing and organizing documents
- Preparing financial reports

**Maintenance Coordination**: 4-6 hours per week
- Fielding maintenance calls
- Coordinating with contractors
- Following up on work orders
- Documenting repairs and costs

That's 23-36 hours per week on tasks that TenantFlow can either automate completely or reduce by 80%.

### Q: Do I need separate tenant screening?
A: Most platforms include basic screening. For comprehensive background checks, you may need additional services or upgraded plans.

### Q: What about customer support?
A: Look for platforms offering phone, chat, and email support during business hours. Some provide 24/7 support for urgent payment or maintenance issues.

# Tenant Screening: The Complete Guide for Landlords
