A: Typically 2-4 weeks for basic setup, 6-8 weeks for complex portfolios with historical data migration. Plan accordingly to avoid disruption.

### Q: Do I need separate tenant screening?
A: Most platforms include basic screening. For comprehensive background checks, you may need additional services or upgraded plans.

### Q: What about customer support?
A: Look for platforms offering phone, chat, and email support during business hours. Some provide 24/7 support for urgent payment or maintenance issues.
