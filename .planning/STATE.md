## Next Steps

Run `/gsd:execute-plan .planning/phases/18-supabase-client-patterns/18-01-PLAN.md` to execute the plan.

Key finding from research: The codebase already implements Supabase best practices correctly. This plan focuses on configuration verification and documentation, not code refactoring.
