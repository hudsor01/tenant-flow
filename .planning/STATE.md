# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-08)

**Core value:** Every public claim on tenantflow.app must map to working code, and every visual must align to canonical design tokens in `src/app/globals.css`.
**Current focus:** Phase 10 — cta-conversion

## Current Position

Phase: 10
Plan: 01 of 02 complete
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-05-20

Progress: [█████████░] 87%

## Locked Decisions (see PROJECT.md Key Decisions for full table)

- Mode: YOLO / autonomous
- Granularity: fine (13 phases)
- Models: quality (Opus on heavy reasoning)
- Per-phase research: ON (every phase)
- Branching: per-phase
- PR strategy: one PR per phase, perfect-PR gate (2 zero-finding cycles)
- Code review: deep
- Major-version-only milestone naming
- Persona word: TBD (researcher recommends during /gsd-plan-phase 4)
- Sales CTA label: "Contact Sales"
- Mobile hamburger: shadcn `Sheet` slide-in drawer from right
- Pricing: full restructure in Phase 5 (not propagation)
- Blog: full rebuild + n8n redesign in Phase 6
- Footer "Powered by Hudson Digital": KEPT
- Social proof: "Built for landlords with 1–15 rentals" (not fabricated count)
- Testimonials: real names + property counts + quotes, no headshots

## Blockers

None.

## Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 14 added: Battle Test Findings Remediation — close /blog 503, skeleton+empty precedence, Stripe.js noise on /pricing, public 404 lacks marketing nav

## Next Action

Execute Plan 10-02 — the second plan of Phase 10 (cta-conversion). Plan 10-01 complete: CONS-06/07/08 regression pins added (14 tests across 3 new files, no production source touched).
