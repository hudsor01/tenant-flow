## ðŸ“ˆ Workflow Examples

### Fix Failing Tests
```
You: /test-fix-workflow.md
Cline: I'll fix the 10 failing frontend tests systematically...
[Analyzes failures, fixes React 19 issues, validates each fix]
Cline: All tests now pass! Would you like me to commit these fixes?
```

### Develop New Feature  
```
You: /feature-development.md
Cline: Let's develop a new feature! What would you like to build?
You: A tenant invitation system
Cline: [Creates backend service, frontend components, tests, PR]
```

### Review Pull Request
```
You: /pr-review.md 123
Cline: [Analyzes PR, checks TenantFlow standards, provides recommendation]
Cline: Based on my review, I recommend approving this PR because...
```

### Complete Supabase Migration
```
You: /supabase-migration.md  
Cline: [Analyzes Prisma usage, migrates to Supabase, validates RLS]
Cline: Migration complete! All services now use Supabase with RLS.
```

## ðŸŽ¯ When to Use Each Workflow

### Use Test Fix Workflow When:
- Frontend tests are failing after updates
- React 19 compatibility issues arise
- Need systematic test debugging
- Pre-commit validation fails

### Use Feature Development When:
- Building new functionality
- Need to follow TenantFlow patterns
- Want automated PR creation
- Implementing multi-tenant features

### Use PR Review When:
- Reviewing team member contributions
- Need TenantFlow-specific validation
- Want automated security checks
- Ensuring architecture compliance

### Use Supabase Migration When:
- Removing Prisma dependencies
- Implementing RLS policies
- Modernizing database access patterns
- Improving multi-tenant security

## ðŸ”’ Security & Best Practices

All workflows enforce TenantFlow's security standards:
- **RLS Compliance**: Every database operation filtered by org_id
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all user inputs
- **Type Safety**: No `any` types, strict TypeScript
- **Architecture Patterns**: BaseCrudService and server-first components

## ðŸš¦ Prerequisites

Before using workflows, ensure:
1. **Environment**: Node 22+, npm 10+
2. **Authentication**: GitHub CLI authenticated (`gh auth status`)
3. **Dependencies**: All packages installed (`npm install`)
4. **Database**: Supabase connection configured

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Chaining

Workflows can be chained for complex operations:
```
1. /supabase-migration.md     # Complete Prisma migration
2. /test-fix-workflow.md      # Fix any broken tests
3. /feature-development.md    # Build new features
4. /pr-review.md <PR-number>  # Review and merge
```

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

Each workflow tracks success through:
- **Test Coverage**: Maintains 80%+ coverage
- **Type Safety**: Zero TypeScript errors
- **Security**: All RLS policies validated
- **Performance**: Build times optimized
- **Quality**: `npm run claude:check` passes
