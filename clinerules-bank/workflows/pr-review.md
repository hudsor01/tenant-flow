# TenantFlow PR Review Workflow

You have access to the `gh` terminal command. I already authenticated it for you. Please review the PR that I asked you to review. You're already in the `tenant-flow` repo.

# TenantFlow PR Review Process - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Gather PR Information

1. Get the PR title, description, and comments:
   ```bash
   gh pr view <PR-number> --json title,body,comments,author
   ```

2. Get the full diff of the PR:
   ```bash
   gh pr diff <PR-number>
   ```

3. Get PR status and checks:
   ```bash
   gh pr checks <PR-number>
   ```

## 2. Understand TenantFlow Context

1. Identify which files were modified and their significance:
   ```bash
   gh pr view <PR-number> --json files
   ```

2. For backend changes, examine the original files:
   ```xml
   <read_file>
   <path>apps/backend/src/[modified-file]</path>
   </read_file>
   ```

3. For frontend changes, check React 19 compatibility:
   ```xml
   <search_files>
   <path>apps/frontend/src</path>
   <regex>'use client'|useEffect|useState</regex>
   <file_pattern>*.tsx</file_pattern>
   </search_files>
   ```

4. For shared changes, verify type safety:
   ```xml
   <read_file>
   <path>packages/shared/src/types/[relevant-type].ts</path>
   </read_file>
   ```

## 3. TenantFlow-Specific Analysis

1. **Security Review** - Check for RLS compliance:
   ```xml
   <search_files>
   <path>apps/backend/src</path>
   <regex>org_id|auth\.jwt|RLS</regex>
   <file_pattern>*.ts</file_pattern>
   </search_files>
   ```

2. **Architecture Review** - Verify patterns are followed:
   ```xml
   <search_files>
   <path>apps</path>
   <regex>BaseCrudService|extends.*Service</regex>
   <file_pattern>*.ts</file_pattern>
   </search_files>
   ```

3. **Multi-tenant Review** - Ensure org_id filtering:
   ```xml
   <search_files>
   <path>apps/backend/src</path>
   <regex>\.from\(|\.select\(|\.insert\(</regex>
   <file_pattern>*.repository.ts,*.service.ts</file_pattern>
   </search_files>
   ```

4. **Type Safety Review** - Check shared type usage:
   ```xml
   <search_files>
   <path>apps</path>
   <regex>from '@repo/shared'</regex>
   <file_pattern>*.ts,*.tsx</file_pattern>
   </search_files>
   ```

## 4. Quality Checks

1. **React 19 Compatibility** (for frontend changes):
   - Server components used by default
   - Client components minimal and marked with 'use client'
   - Proper act() wrapping in tests
   - No deprecated React patterns

2. **Security Compliance**:
   - All database operations use RLS policies
   - No hardcoded secrets or API keys
   - Input validation with Zod schemas
   - Proper error handling without data leaks

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Lazy loading for large components
   - Image optimization with Next.js Image
   - Minimal client-side JavaScript
   - Efficient database queries

4. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Unit tests for services
   - E2E tests for critical flows
   - No skipped tests without reason
   - Proper test patterns for React 19

## 5. Ask for User Confirmation

1. Present comprehensive assessment:
   ```xml
   <ask_followup_question>
   <question>Based on my review of PR #<PR-number> from @<author>, here's my assessment:

   **Changes Summary:**
   [Brief description of what was changed]

   **Security Review:**
   - ‚úÖ/‚ùå RLS policies properly implemented
   - ‚úÖ/‚ùå No hardcoded secrets
   - ‚úÖ/‚ùå Input validation present

   **Architecture Review:**
   - ‚úÖ/‚ùå Follows BaseCrudService pattern
   - ‚úÖ/‚ùå Server components first approach
   - ‚úÖ/‚ùå Uses shared types correctly

   **Quality Review:**
   - ‚úÖ/‚ùå Tests included and passing
   - ‚úÖ/‚ùå React 19 compatibility
   - ‚úÖ/‚ùå TypeScript strict compliance

   **Recommendation:** [APPROVE/REQUEST CHANGES]

   **Reasoning:** [Detailed explanation of recommendation]

   Would you like me to proceed with this recommendation?</question>
   <options>["Yes, approve the PR", "Yes, request changes", "No, I'd like to discuss further", "Let me review manually first"]</options>
   </ask_followup_question>
   ```

## 6. Handle TenantFlow-Specific Feedback

1. If requesting changes, focus on TenantFlow priorities:
   - Multi-tenant security issues
   - React 19 compatibility problems
   - Architecture pattern violations
   - Missing test coverage for critical flows

2. If approving, highlight good practices:
   - Proper RLS implementation
   - Clean architecture patterns
   - Good test coverage
   - Performance considerations

## 7. Ask if User Wants Comment Drafted

1. After decision, offer to draft comment:
   ```xml
   <ask_followup_question>
   <question>Would you like me to draft a comment for this PR that follows TenantFlow's review style?</question>
   <options>["Yes, please draft a comment", "No, I'll handle the comment myself"]</options>
   </ask_followup_question>
   ```

## 8. Make Decision with TenantFlow Context

1. **Approve the PR** if it meets standards:
   ```bash
   cat << EOF | gh pr review <PR-number> --approve --body-file -
   Thanks @<author> for this PR! 

   I like how you've implemented [specific good practices]. The [feature/fix] looks solid and follows TenantFlow's architecture patterns well.

   Specifically appreciated:
   - ‚úÖ Proper RLS implementation with org_id filtering
   - ‚úÖ Server-first component approach  
   - ‚úÖ Use of shared types from @repo/shared
   - ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage

   Great work maintaining the multi-tenant security model!
   EOF
   ```

2. **Request changes** if improvements needed:
   ```bash
   cat << EOF | gh pr review <PR-number> --request-changes --body-file -
   Thanks @<author> for this PR!

   The implementation looks promising, but I've spotted a few things that need attention for TenantFlow's standards:

   **Security & Multi-tenancy:**
   - [Specific security issues if any]

   **Architecture:**
   - [Architecture pattern issues if any]

   **Testing:**
   - [Testing issues if any]

   Once these are addressed, this will be ready to merge. Let me know if you need any clarification on TenantFlow's patterns!
   EOF
   ```

3. **Comment without approval/rejection** for minor feedback:
   ```bash
   cat << EOF | gh pr review <PR-number> --comment --body-file -
   Thanks @<author> for this PR!

   Overall this looks good. Just a couple of minor suggestions:

   [Minor feedback points]

   Nice work following TenantFlow's architecture patterns!

# Common TenantFlow Issues to Watch For

## Security Issues
```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad: Direct query without RLS
const properties = await supabase.from('properties').select('*')

// ‚úÖ Good: RLS automatically filters by org_id
const properties = await this.propertyRepository.findAll()
```

## Architecture Issues
```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad: Direct Supabase in controller
@Get()
async getProperties() {
  return await this.supabase.from('properties').select('*')
}

// ‚úÖ Good: Service layer with patterns
@Get()
async getProperties() {
  return await this.propertyService.findAll()
}
```

## React 19 Issues
```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad: Client component when server works
'use client'
export function PropertyList({ properties }) {
  return <div>{properties.map(...)}</div>
}

// ‚úÖ Good: Server component first
export function PropertyList({ properties }) {
  return <div>{properties.map(...)}</div>
}
```

## Type Safety Issues
```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad: Local type definition
interface Property {
  id: string
  name: string
}

// ‚úÖ Good: Shared type usage
import { Property } from '@repo/shared'
```
