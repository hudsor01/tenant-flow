-- TenantFlow Seed Data (Placeholder)
-- ========================================
-- Note: The original seed script was designed for a Prisma-style schema
-- with PascalCase table names. The current schema uses snake_case.
--
-- For local development, you can:
-- 1. Create test data via the application
-- 2. Run integration tests which create their own fixtures
--
-- This file is intentionally minimal to allow supabase start to succeed.
