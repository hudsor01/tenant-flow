-- CRIT-03 filter-audit completeness (Phase 25 review cycle 3).
--
-- Migration 20260702215602 fixed get_dashboard_stats.unit_agg.total_units but
-- left three sibling unit aggregates inactive-inclusive:
--   * unit_agg.avg_rent            (AVG over all units incl. inactive)
--   * unit_agg.total_potential_rent (SUM over all units incl. inactive)
--   * property_unit_counts.tot     (COUNT feeding property_agg.occupancy_rate denom)
-- This made get_dashboard_stats disagree with its canonical sibling
-- get_dashboard_data_v2 (which excludes inactive via its pre-filtered all_units
-- CTE) once a unit is soft-deleted. No live UI consumed these three fields, so
-- there was no user-visible impact, but the RPC returned incorrect data.
--
-- Fix: add FILTER (WHERE u.status <> 'inactive') to those three aggregates only.
-- Single-table scans -> plain `<>` (no LEFT-JOIN phantom rows). Occupied/available/
-- maintenance numerators and total_actual_rent ('occupied'-filtered) are untouched.
-- Verified: only these 3 aggregates changed (4 total inactive-filters in the body);
-- grants/search_path/SECURITY DEFINER preserved; rolled-back before/after proof
-- shows total_potential_rent + averageRent drop from 1500 -> 0 when the unit is
-- soft-deleted.
