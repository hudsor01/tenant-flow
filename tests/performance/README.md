# Performance Obsession Testing Suite - Apple Standards

This comprehensive performance testing suite implements Apple's obsession-critical performance standards, ensuring every user interaction meets sub-200ms response time and provides exceptional satisfaction.

## 🎯 Apple's Performance Philosophy

This testing suite is built around Apple's core principle: **Performance is a Feature**. Every interaction must be:

- **Sub-200ms Response**: All interactions complete within 200ms for satisfying UX
- **Tactile Satisfaction**: Button presses and micro-interactions feel rewarding
- **Bored Browsing Ready**: Mindless exploration remains engaging and responsive
- **Buttery Smooth**: 60fps scroll performance with minimal jank
- **Contextual Loading**: Loading states are informative and entertaining
